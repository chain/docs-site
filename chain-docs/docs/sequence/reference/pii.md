Sequence is backed by an append-only blockchain data model, which enables us to provide a secure, verifiable, and auditable ledger service. This append-only model means data stored in your ledger is permanent.

Therefore, Sequence is not an appropriate place to store personally identifiable information (PII), like names, email addresses, social security numbers, date of birth, credit card details, or any other information that can be used to identify an individual person and may need to be redacted.

To correlate accounts in Sequence with users in your application, use internal identifiers or hashed data instead.
