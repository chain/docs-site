Sequence is a ledger-as-a-service for managing balances. It combines the power of a token-based data model with the convenience of the cloud, making it easy to build, operate, and scale forward-thinking products. Sequence can securely track any type of value, letting software teams focus on shipping and scaling their products instead of building and maintaining ledger infrastructure.

Sequence is used as a system of record by a diverse set of companies including mobile wallets, crypto asset exchanges, lending platforms, sharing economy apps, payment services, funding sites, asset managers, and many more. Any application that needs to record transactions and calculate balances can benefit from using Sequence.
