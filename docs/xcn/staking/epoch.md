In the Chain Protocol each round consists of a 28 day cycle known as epochs. When a current round is completed the next epoch begins. 7 days after the conclusion of an epoch, users will be able to claim their rewards. This time lapse is dynamic and is controlled by the Chain DAO. Users do not begin accruing rewards until after 1 full Epoch plus the current Epoch they are in . For example I make a deposit on the 27th day of Epoch 1. I won’t start accruing rewards until Epoch 3. Same goes for those depositing on Day 2 of Epoch 1. They won’t start accruing rewards until Epoch 3.
