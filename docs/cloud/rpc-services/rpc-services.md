# RPC services

To enable distributed network of cloud computing designed to enable Nodes with Kubernetes containers and Clusters that enable Docker images deployment for nodes and supporting Helm charts. These nodes will enable users to connect via API in a public endpoint(1) and private endpoints(multiple). The endpoints are scalable to add as many servers to cluster as possible. (supports EVM blockchains and Bitcoin-based chains). The public API is free and will have restrictions. The Premium API is paid via XCN (20% Off) tokens or Credit Card and has added features. (Which can be turned off just to accept via XCN)

* Chain Cloud provides public and free RPC for users around the world. The system consists of kubernates clusters based in US, EU and Asia, which decrease the latency to minimum, meet users and developers' basic needs.
* The API Gateway helps the process of load balancing the RPC requests from users to the fullnodes deployed in the kubernates clusters, which optimizes the full nodes' performance.
