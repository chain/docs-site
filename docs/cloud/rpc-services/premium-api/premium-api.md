### Benefits[​](https://www.ankr.com/docs/build-blockchain/products/v2/premium-plan/#benefits) <a href="#benefits" id="benefits"></a>

Premium API is a set of _secure_ and _private_ RPC endpoints exclusive to you. They provide greater reliability by interfacing with a fully distributed, ultra low latency node pool.

Enjoy the following benefits:

* At times of network congestion, Premium API requests are prioritized.
* Establish a durable, low-latency connection via the websocket endpoint and have data pushed incrementally directly to you as soon as it is available. This makes it ideal for real-time data analytics.

:::caution
The WebSocket API limits the maximum number of simultaneous connections to provide protection against misuse, such as DDoS attacks, for example. If your Websocket client makes too many connections at the same time, an error message will be received.
