As users paid for Premium API using, they will get an API key and access to Premium API UI for extra security

<!-- ![Premium API Detail page](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>) -->

The security of Premium plan consists 2 parts.

1. Your personal API Key: API key is aim to protect premium users from leaking to public. With API key we can detect exactly who is using the premium RPC. In the case your API key is leaked, you can refresh for a new API key by clicking "Refresh API Key"
2. We provided an additional security function for the end-users by blocking every connection excepted the whitelisted one. The connection can only be made by whitelisting the website addresses and IP addresses (in decentralized systems).
