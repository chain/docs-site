# Staking

Chain Staking comprises of staking and depositing your XCN into the non-custodial staking smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. By staking XCN you are securing the network by ensuring proper governance and risk controls are set to avoid malicious actors from attacking the protocol.

XCN that is staked in the protocol can participate in Chain Governance and earn rewards for securing the protocol.

The proposed parameters of staking will be:

Rewards - Activates next epoch\
Withdrawal - Next epoch\
Rewards claim - 7 days after epoch\
Rewards Rate - 100,000 divided by your XCN weight % against the total XCN staked for Governance.
