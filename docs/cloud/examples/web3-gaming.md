# Web3 Gaming

### Introduction​

These use case has been developed specifically for gaming studios looking to launch Web3 games using our services.

### Dedicated throughput for gaming transactions

Web3 games — depending on their user base of players and popularity — typically require extremely high throughput in order to process a high volume of transactions. With thousands of players interacting with all kinds of tokenized in-game content, it’s not unfeasible for a Web3 game to need to process many millions of transactions per day.

Depending on the level of tokenization you integrate into your game, you may have players performing transactions on-chain to customize their avatars, equip new items, purchase in-game assets, trade assets to other players, earn rewards for completing in-game objectives, and so much more.

Of course, some games may not process quite as many transactions until they rise in popularity, it’s best to be prepared for the potential traffic that a successful Web3 game might eventually experience.

### Node ownership

Again, this is a topic that will require attention to your individual situation. You can have Chain Cloud host nodes for you. 

This will likely depend on your level of Web3 knowledge and experience hosting blockchain nodes. Chain Cloud can help you with hosting full nodes to support your business.
