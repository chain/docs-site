# Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.
