# Node Staking

### Purchase XCN

Visit any DEX to swap for the desired amount of XCN

### Stake XCN

:::tip
Make sure you have some ETH to pay the gas fee for your staking transaction.

Currently, **XCN can only be staked on Ethereum**.

You can claim your rewards after the locking period of 30 days. This period applies to each staking transaction independently. However, your stake will keep generating rewards until you unstake.
:::

:::caution
You have to stake every time you deploy a protocol node. If you unstake, the node will be terminated immediately.&#x20;
